# Restaurant Reviews Classification

## Overview
Classifies restaurant reviews as positive or negative sentiment using natural language processing techniques.

## Dataset
- This project uses the [Restaurant Reviews Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ishanshrivastava/restaurant-reviews).
- Contains 1,000 restaurant reviews labeled as positive or negative.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook.

## Approach
1. Load and clean text data  
2. Perform text preprocessing (tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming)  
3. Convert text to numerical features using Bag of Words / TF-IDF  
4. Train classification models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, etc.)  
5. Evaluate with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score  

## Results
Achieved high accuracy in classifying sentiment of restaurant reviews.
