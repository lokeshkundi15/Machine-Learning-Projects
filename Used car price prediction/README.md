# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview
Predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features such as year, mileage, and brand.  
This helps customers and dealers estimate fair market value.

## Dataset
- This project uses the [Used Car Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/avikasliwal/used-cars-price-prediction).
- Contains details like car brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, and selling price.

## Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter Notebook.

## Approach
1. Load and clean the dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature engineering and encoding categorical variables  
4. Train regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
5. Evaluate performance with RMSE and RÂ² score  

## Results
Built a regression model capable of predicting used car prices with good accuracy.
